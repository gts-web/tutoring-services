## Welcome to About page

Hi there — I’m Gobi, and I’m so glad you stopped by! I’m a STEM tutor with a background in engineering and a big passion for teaching. I’ve earned a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Systems Engineering and a Master of Engineering in Telecommunication Engineering from the University of Toronto, and I’m also a licensed Professional Engineer (P.Eng) in software and IT.

I’ve spent years working in the tech world as a cloud solutions architect, and now I’m bringing that real-world experience into my tutoring. I help students in Grades 6 to 12 tackle subjects like Math, Science, Technology, and Engineering, all based on the Ontario curriculum.

My tutoring style is friendly, supportive, and interactive. I believe learning should be clear, relatable, and — yes — even fun sometimes! Whether it’s getting ready for a test, keeping up with classwork, or diving deeper into tricky topics, I’m here to help you feel confident and capable.

When I’m not tutoring or working in tech, you’ll probably find me exploring new tech gadgets, working on fun side projects, or hanging out with my Morkie dog!

Looking forward to learning together!
